% pixels: data pixels, L*N
% p: number of endmember classes
% bundles: number of subsets of the data
% percent: percentage of the data taken each time
% clustering: either 'kmeans' or 'spectral_clustering'
% sampling is without replacement within one bundle the same pixel can be
% sampled in several bundles.
